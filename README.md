This is the KESA kOS repository. 

We have different scripts for different parts of the mission. 

We have the main Libary with supporting stuff: 

LIB/kesalib.ks

then there are some variables about planetary bodies

LIB/bodyprops.ks

all you need to get into orbit is stored in the LTO (Launch To Orbit) folder.

The main scripts: 
LTO/lto.ks
LTO/lctl.ks


DISCLAIMER: I am using a lot of code from http://kos.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_toolkit_v3 which is written b y "Baloan". I could not find any license there :(  Whoever you are, you have done a great job, even if I don't understand some parts why you did this and that in the way you did it. Her/his code is being used in following scripts: 

- LTO/lto.ks
- LTO/bodyprops.ks
- ORBIT/*all of them* (exept copycode.ks)


DISCLAIMER II: you can ask me anything about the scripts, maybe I will even anwser you, but I will not deepen into a discussion, with the most of you, why I am dooing things in this way and why not doing it in another way. I do not have the time for such things. Some parts of the scripts are being adapted to new technology which were invented by our Kerbal scientist.  

 
Have fun and happy launchings
